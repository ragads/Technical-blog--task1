Machine learning-enabled multiscale modeling platform for damage sensing digital twin in piezoelectric composite structures,"Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of aerospace structures plays a crucial role in their successful operation under harsh environments. Most NDE methods, however, lack real-time in-situ predictive capabilities of evolving damage and are conducted in a post-mortem manner. This paper proposes a damage-sensing digital twin (DT) for piezoelectric composite structures incorporating microscale morphology and mechanisms into structural damage to address this shortcoming. The DT framework consists of a two-step computational process integrating multiscale-multiphysics modeling with machine learning (ML) tools to detect damage progression in the piezoelectric composite structure using electrical signal measurements at a few surface points. A parametrically upscaled coupled constitutive damage mechanics (PUCCDM) model is developed for this DT with the representation of microstructural morphology and mechanisms in macroscopic constitutive relations. Artificial neural network operates on micro-electro-mechanical data to derive PUCCDM constitutive coefficients as functions of underlying representative aggregated microstructural parameters (RAMPs). The PUCCDM model-simulated macroscopic electromechanical and damage fields, in conjunction with RAMPs, provide a comprehensive time-dependent dataset for a convolutional long-short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network to learn microstructure-dependent electrical and damage field correlations. The DT is consequently used to successfully predict location-specific damage from electrical signals at a limited number of sensors.","['Somnath Ghosh', 'Saikat Dan', 'Preetam Tarafder']",24-Feb-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-91196-5
Influence of behavior of a coupled dynamic system on an energy harvester,"This paper examines the behavior of a two-degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) kinematic system of the spring pendulum coupled to a harvester. The harvester is the electromagnetic device that is reliant on a magnet’s oscillation within a coil. Using the Lagrangian, the governing equations of motion (GEOM) are generated. The multiple-time-scales approach (MTSA) is employed to provide the analytical solutions (AS) for these equations up the third-order of approximations. To ascertain these solutions, we juxtapose them with numerical ones. The modulation equations are set up, and the principal external resonance instances are investigated concurrently upon the solvability constraints. A schematic representation of the dynamical system’s behavior is provided by the time histories, phase portraits, and nonlinear stability analysis of the modulation equations. Moreover, the time histories of the electromagnetic harvester’s current, power, and voltage are shown to illustrate how various parameters impact the generation of electrical energy. According to the Routh-Hurwitz stability criteria (RHSC), stability/instability regions exist wherein the behavior of the examined system is stable over a large range of applied parameters. In addition, stable/unstable fixed points within the scenario of steady-state are distinguished. This work’s relevance is confined to the practical implementations of its findings in daily life, including energy sources for the industrial, electronic and medical devices.","['Asmaa Amer', 'W.

Analysis of gear transmission error in helical gear using enhanced tooth contact analysis model considering measured tooth profile errors,"A loaded tooth contact analysis model was developed to assess transmission error by incorporating profile errors in a helical gear pair. Profile errors for all teeth of both the pinion and wheel were measured, and the mean profile error was computed and integrated into the model. To validate the model, static transmission error (STE) was measured experimentally. The experimental results, particularly the peak-to-peak static transmission error (PPSTE) in relation to torque and tooth-meshing harmonics, demonstrated consistency with the simulation outcomes. Subsequently, the model was employed to investigate the impact of surface waviness (SW) on the STE, focusing on SW amplitude, spatial frequency, and initial phase. It was observed that both the amplitude and spatial frequency of the SW influenced the PPSTE and the harmonic characteristics of the transmission error, while the initial phase of the waviness had no significant effect.","['Dongu Im', 'Woo-Jin Chung', 'Hyunggon Lee', 'You-Jin Lee', 'Hyunjoon Sung', 'Minwook Lee', 'Young-Jun Park']",18-Feb-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90010-6
Compact circularly polarized dual band antenna with modified patch for ISM and V2X communication systems,"This paper introduces a novel design and development of a compact circularly polarized antenna operating at two distinct frequency bands, 2.5 GHz and 6 GHz. The innovation lies in using a modified circular patch and a uniquely designed feeding element, which optimize circular polarization performance while maintaining a low-profile form factor. Fabricated on an FR4 substrate with an overall thickness of 1.6 mm and dimensions of 62 mm × 62 mm × 1.6 mm, corresponding to approximately 0.5167λ × 0.5167λ × 0.0133λ at 2.5 GHz, the antenna achieves a compact configuration well-suited for space-constrained applications. Extensive simulations and measurements show close agreement, with axial ratios below 3 dB across both operational bands, ensuring effective circular polarization. The antenna achieves peak gains of 1.8 dBi at 2.5 GHz and 3.8 dBi at 6 GHz, highlighting its ability to combine compactness, dual-band functionality, and strong radiation characteristics. This proposed design provides a groundbreaking solution for Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication systems, addressing the increasing demand for efficient, dual-band, and space-saving wireless communication solutions.","['E.

Innovative adaptive edge detection for noisy images using wavelet and Gaussian method,"Edge detection is a crucial task in image processing and remote sensing, particularly for accurately identifying and separating shapes in noisy digital images. To enhance robustness and detail in edge detection, this study presents an innovative edge detection method, which integrates a denoising module and an adaptive thresholding technique to effectively address challenges associated with Gaussian noise in images. The proposed denoising module employs wavelet and Gaussian denoising functions to decompose, filter, and reconstruct the image, thereby reducing the impact of noise and enhancing image quality. For edge detection, an adaptive thresholding method based on a modified OTSU method is utilized. Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed framework by comparing detected edges against ground truth across various levels of Gaussian noise (0.1%, 10%, 20%, and 30%). The median thresholding function is chosen for its stability and convenience, while hard thresholding is avoided due to its tendency to introduce artifacts. Objective metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Accuracy, and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), are employed for evaluation. Comparative results indicate that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods, such as Canny and Roberts, showcasing its effectiveness in edge detection.","['Huanxu Li', 'Keke Xu']",18-Feb-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86860-9
Parallel robotic automated docking method for realizing space segment assembly,"Assembling large, heavy space segments presents a significant challenge in aerospace engine production. Rigid collisions often occur during the docking process, impacting the precision and quality of engine assembly. Traditional manual docking depends on workers’ experience to prevent collisions, but it is labor-intensive and low in productivity, making it impractical. Parallel robots, known for their high precision and heavy load capacity, are widely used in precision assembly under heavy load conditions. Therefore, automated docking methods using parallel robots capable of avoiding rigid collisions have emerged as an excellent solution to these issues. This paper presents a framework for easy implementation in practical production. The Stewart parallel robot facilitates automatic docking of heavy aerospace components without rigid collisions. Fractional-order variable damping admittance control is proposed, allowing the robot to dynamically adjust the assembly trajectory based on real-time interaction forces, thus preventing rigid collisions during docking. Additionally, adaptive robust sliding mode control is developed, enhancing the robot’s tracking accuracy for desired poses and making it suitable for high-precision assembly.","['Deyuan Sun', 'Ruihan Xu', 'Junyi Wang', 'Zhigang Xu', 'Runan Cao']",17-Feb-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-89777-5
Reservoir computing-based signal compensation for laser inter-satellite communications,"We introduce the reservoir computing (RC) concept into the laser processing unit for the scenario of the inter-satellite communication to mitigate the impacts from the multi-distortion sources, enabling significantly improving the quality of the coherent signals through the intelligent approach in outer space. We carry out the experimental investigations to quantify the impacts from the Sun radiation, the Doppler frequency shift and the vibration on the transmitted quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK) signals, and perform the signal compensation through only one RC module at the receiver end.

Experimental system and method of aerobic thermal environment simulation based on laser heating,"Considering the superior luminous intensity characteristics of lasers, a thermal simulation platform employing laser-induced heating in an aerobic environment was developed. Achieving a uniformly distributed flat-topped square laser beam output was facilitated through optical fibre bundling techniques, while precise control over laser power output was attained through current modulation. Utilising the aforementioned system, thermal shock simulation experiments were conducted in an aerobic environment, subjecting two types of high-temperature-resistant composites, namely C/C and C/SiC, to temperatures up to 1800 °C. These composites were lightweight, heat-resistant materials designed for hypersonic vehicle applications. The results show that the system and method can be used to simulate high temperatures, rapid temperature increases, and thermal shocks on C/C composite materials, with minimal variation in the coupling coefficient under aerobic conditions. The system and method can also provide key technology support for thermal-force-oxygen coupling testing of high temperature resistant materials.","['Jiawei Wang', 'Bin Li', 'Shengwu Li', 'Sihao Gao', 'Yanlong Shen', 'Dahui Wang', 'Pengling Yang']",15-Jul-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-67426-7
Sunlight-powered sustained flight of an ultralight micro aerial vehicle,"Limited flight duration is a considerable obstacle to the widespread application of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs)1,2,3, especially for ultralightweight MAVs weighing less than 10 g, which, in general, have a flight endurance of no more than 10 min (refs. 1,4). Sunlight power5,6,7 is a potential alternative to improve the endurance of ultralight MAVs, but owing to the restricted payload capacity of the vehicle and low lift-to-power efficiency of traditional propulsion systems, previous studies have not achieved untethered sustained flight of MAVs fully powered by natural sunlight8,9. Here, to address these challenges, we introduce the CoulombFly, an electrostatic flyer consisting of an electrostatic-driven propulsion system with a high lift-to-power efficiency of 30.7 g W−1 and an ultralight kilovolt power system with a low power consumption of 0.568 W, to realize solar-powered sustained flight of an MAV under natural sunlight conditions (920 W m−2). The vehicle’s total mass is only 4.21 g, within 1/600 of the existing lightest sunlight-powered aerial vehicle6.","['Wei Shen', 'Jinzhe Peng', 'Rui Ma', 'Jiaqing Wu', 'Jingyi Li', 'Zhiwei Liu', 'Jiaming Leng', 'Xiaojun Yan', 'Mingjing Qi']",17-Jul-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07609-4
Exploring technology acceptance of flight simulation training devices and augmented reality in general aviation pilot training,"This study investigates pilot perspectives on the use of Flight Simulation Training Devices (FSTDs) in Canada’s general aviation (GA) sector, which, despite their longstanding adoption, remain underutilized.

Influence of the non-equal aligned nozzles for fuel injection inside the supersonic combustion chamber,"The importance of fuel mixing for the progress of the scramjet engine is indisputable. The present article shows the importance of the non-equal multi-injector system for effective fuel distribution and flame holding inside the combustion segment of a scramjet engine. The supersonic air and fuel jet flow in the non-equal nozzle arrangement is simulated via computational fluid dynamic technique. Two injector types of circular and rectangular nozzle have been analyzed to attain flow characteristics of hydrogen jets at supersonic cross flow. Mach contour is also analyzed for these jet arrangements to show the interface of the jet in the non-equal jet arrangement. Besides, addition of internal air jet is also simulated and evaluated in this research. Our investigation shows that the diffusion height of the fuel jet is higher when a rectangular non-equal nozzle is applied. The circular nozzle is more active in the spreading of the fuel in the combustor and the use of an internal air jet effectively increases fuel in a combustor of the scramjet.","['Zhongmian Fan', 'Lingxiao Wang', 'Fei Xu', 'Xiuli Zhang', 'Baoling Xie', 'Yushi Wen', 'He Li', 'Saman Aminian']",04-Jun-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63544-4

Prediction of oxidation resistance of Ti-V-Cr burn resistant titanium alloy based on machine learning,"A machine learning model was developed to predict the oxidation resistance of Ti-V-Cr burn-resistant titanium alloy, and the natural logarithm of the parabolic oxidation rate constant (lnkp) was utilized as the model output. The results show that the two algorithms based on multiple learners, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), show better performance.

A spherical vector-based adaptive evolutionary particle swarm optimization for UAV path planning under threat conditions,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning is a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. With the increasing scale of UAV applications, finding an efficient and safe path in complex real-world environments is crucial. However, existing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms struggle with these problems as they fail to consider UAV dynamics, resulting in many infeasible solutions and poor convergence to optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a spherical vector-based adaptive evolutionary particle swarm optimization (SAEPSO) algorithm. This algorithm, based on spherical vectors, directly incorporates UAV dynamic constraints and introduces improved tent map and reverse learning to enhance the diversity and distribution of initial solutions. Additionally, dynamic nonlinear and adaptive factors are integrated to balance exploration and exploitation capabilities. To avoid local optima in highly complex environments, we propose an adaptive acceleration strategy for poor particles, and an evolutionary programming strategy is incorporated to further improve the optimization capability. Finally, we conducted comparative studies and in six benchmark scenarios with varying threat levels, and the results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms others in the initial solution effectiveness, the final solution accuracy, convergence stability, and scalability.","['Yanfei Liu', 'Hao Zhang', 'Hao Zheng', 'Qi Li', 'Qi Tian']",16-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-85912-4
Identification and correction of phase delay errors for hemispherical resonator gyroscopes,"The phase-delay error of the circuit system is the primary source of the output error observed in the hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG). Additionally, the temperature-dependent nature of the phase-delay error results in a deterioration of the initial calibration parameters, which, in turn, significantly impairs the performance of the gyroscope in its intended application. This paper proposes a self-calibration method to effectively suppress the impact of phase-delay error on the application performance of gyroscopes. Firstly, based on the analysis of the influence of phase-delay error on the performance of the whole-angle mode HRG, a sinusoidal interference signal with a small amplitude is introduced into the quadrature control loop of the gyroscope. Then, the angular rate signal is demodulated and calculated to obtain the phase-delay error of the system, which is employed as the compensation value of the reference phase of the PLL to offset the phase-delay error of the circuit system in real-time. The experimental results demonstrate that after the phase-delay error is self-calibrated, the zero-bias output error of the gyroscope is reduced by 5 times, the bias instability is improved by 37.7%, and the self-calibration method of the phase-delay error presented is more strongly robust to temperature changes.","['Youhuan Ning', 'Changhong Wang', 'Boqi Xi', 'Zhen Tian', 'Boda Zhang']",15-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86288-1
Towards extending the aircraft flight envelope by mitigating transonic airfoil buffet,"In the age of globalization, commercial aviation plays a central role in maintaining our international connectivity by providing fast air transport services for passengers and freight. However, the upper limit of the aircraft flight envelope, i.e., its operational limit in the high-speed (transonic) regime, is usually fixed by the occurrence of transonic aeroelastic effects. These harmful structural vibrations are associated with an aerodynamic instability called transonic buffet. It refers to shock wave oscillations occurring on the aircraft wings, which induce unsteady aerodynamic loads acting on the wing structure. Since the structural response can cause severe structural damage endangering flight safety, the aviation industry is highly interested in suppressing transonic buffet to extend the flight envelope to higher aircraft speeds. In this contribution, we demonstrate experimentally that the application of porous trailing edges substantially attenuates the buffet phenomenon. Since porous trailing edges have the additional benefit of reducing acoustic aircraft emissions, they could prospectively provide faster air transport with reduced noise emissions.","['Esther Lagemann', 'Steven L.

Ground validation of manipulator adaptive variable admittance control method for detumbling a space noncooperative satellite,"To achieve rapid and stable detumbling of a space noncooperative satellite, an adaptive variable admittance control method for the manipulator is proposed and verified through simulation study and the ground experiment. The control block diagram of the proposed method is presented, and the adaptive variable admittance compliant detumbling control model is established. The proposed controller includes the fixed admittance controller in manipulator task space, the adaptive pose compensator for the grasping point on docking ring, and the damping adaptive regulator based on manipulator joint angular velocity, and the stability is proven by the Lyapunov method. Subsequently, the advantage of proposed method is verified through simulation comparison with other compliant detumbling methods, demonstrating the ability to reduce the velocity and angular velocity of the space noncooperative satellite in a shorter time. Finally, the composition of the designed ground hardware-in-the-loop verification platform are demonstrated, and on this basis, verification principle is elaborated. The ground experiment process for detumbling a space noncooperative spinning satellite is formulated, and the time sequence for its five phases is planned. The experimental results show that during the relative detumbling process, the spin angular velocity of the simulated space noncooperative satellite gradually decreases to the desired value of − 0.089°/s, significantly outperforming the fixed admittance control method. At the end of this phase, absolute value of the angular velocity component deviation is only 0.019°/s. Ground test verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method and provides vital basis for its further application.","['Xinlin Bai', 'Xiwen Li', 'Zhen Zhao', 'Zhigang Xu']",14-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86271-w
"Stiff, lightweight, and programmable architectured pyrolytic carbon lattices via modular assembling","Recent advances in additive manufacturing have enabled the creation of three-dimensional (3D) architectured pyrolytic carbon (PyC) structures with ultrahigh specific strength and energy absorption capabilities. However, their scalability is limited by reduced strength at larger sizes. Here we introduce a modular assembling approach to scale up PyC lattice structures while retaining strength. Three assembling mechanisms—adhesive, Lego-adhesive, and mechanical interlocking—are explored, demonstrating notably increased specific compressive strength and modulus as size increases, driven by energy release from assembly joint fractures. Practical application is demonstrated by using assembled PyC lattices as the core of an aerospace sandwich structure, significantly enhancing indentation resistance compared to conventional aramid paper honeycomb core. The method also enables versatile designs, including curved structures for space debris protection and bio-scaffold applications. This scalable approach offers a promising pathway for integrating PyC structures into large-scale engineering applications requiring superior mechanical properties and programmability in complicated shape design.","['Ali Naderi', 'Wenhua Lin', 'Amirreza Tarafdar', 'Teng Zhang', 'Yeqing Wang']",16-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-00739-w
Remote sensing image Super-resolution reconstruction by fusing multi-scale receptive fields and hybrid transformer,"To enhance high-frequency perceptual information and texture details in remote sensing images and address the challenges of super-resolution reconstruction algorithms during training, particularly the issue of missing details, this paper proposes an improved remote sensing image super-resolution reconstruction model. The generator network of the model employs multi-scale convolutional kernels to extract image features and utilizes a multi-head self-attention mechanism to dynamically fuse these features, significantly improving the ability to capture both fine details and global information in remote sensing images. Additionally, the model introduces a multi-stage Hybrid Transformer structure, which processes features at different resolutions progressively, from low resolution to high resolution, substantially enhancing reconstruction quality and detail recovery. The discriminator combines multi-scale convolution, global Transformer, and hierarchical feature discriminators, providing a comprehensive and refined evaluation of image quality. Finally, the model incorporates a Charbonnier loss function and total variation (TV) loss function, which significantly improve training stability and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, compared to the SRGAN algorithm, achieves average improvements of approximately 3.61 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), 0.070 (8.2%) in Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and 0.030 (3.1%) in Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) across multiple datasets, showing significant performance gains.","['Denghui Liu', 'Lin Zhong', 'Haiyang Wu', 'Songyang Li', 'Yida Li']",16-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86446-5
Easy-to-actuate multi-compatible truss structures with prescribed reconfiguration,"Multi-stable structures attract great interest because they possess special energy landscapes with domains of attraction around the stable states. Consequently, multi-stable structures have the potential to achieve prescribed reconfiguration with only a few lightweight actuators (such as shape-memory alloy springs), and do not need constant actuation to be locked at a stable state. However, most existing multi-stability designs are based on assembling bi-stable unit cells, which contain multitudes of distractive stable states, diminishing the feasibility of reconfiguration actuation. Another type is by introducing prestress together with kinematic symmetry or nonlinearity to achieve multi-stability, but the resultant structure often suffers the lack of stiffness. To help address these challenges, we firstly introduce the constraints that a truss structure is simultaneously compatible at multiple (more than two) prescribed states. Then, we solve for the design of multi-stable truss structures, named multi-compatible structures in this paper, where redundant stable states are limited. Secondly, we explore minimum energy paths connecting the designed stable states, and compute for a simple and inaccurate pulling actuation guiding the structure to transform along the computed paths. Finally, we fabricated four prototypes to demonstrate that prescribed reconfigurations with easy-actuation have been achieved and applied a quadra-stable structure to the design of a variable stiffness gripper. Altogether, our full-cycle design approach contains multi-stability design, stiffness design, minimum-energy-path finding, and pulling actuation design, which highlights the potential for designing morphing structures with lightweight actuation for practical applications.","['Lin Ai', 'Shukun Yin', 'Weixia He', 'Peidong Zhang', 'Yang Li']",07-Jun-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49210-3
Examining influencing factors and their hierarchical relationships in flight crew resilient behavior through a hybrid ISM-DEMATEL approach,"The increasing complexity of aviation systems and the rise of unpredictable “Black Swan” events necessitate resilience-based safety management strategies. Flight Crew Resilient Behavior (FCRB), defined as the ability of flight crews to adapt effectively beyond standard operating procedures, is critical for ensuring operational safety. Despite its significance, systematic approaches to understanding and managing FCRB remain underdeveloped. This study builds on American Airlines’ pioneering work by extending the FCRB scope to the Chinese aviation sector, and identifies 22 key factors influencing FCRB across individual, cockpit, organizational, and social dimensions through a comprehensive literature review and expert interviews. A hierarchical model was developed using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to uncover the relationships and layered dependencies among these factors. Subsequently, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was applied to analyze causal relationships and interaction strengths, pinpointing critical driving and dependent factors within the system. The integrated ISM-DEMATEL analysis revealed seven management pathways, offering actionable strategies to enhance FCRB through targeted interventions in knowledge development, safety culture, and responsibility. These findings provide a robust framework for airlines, aviation authorities, and manufacturers to manage FCRB proactively, address both anticipated and unforeseen challenges, and advance aviation safety.","['Peng He', 'Fei Lu', 'Ruishan Sun', 'Zhaoning Zhang']",10-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-85990-4
A Parametric study on the effects of winglet cant angle on wing aerodynamics and aeroacoustics,"The use of winglet devices is an efficient technique for enhancing aerodynamic performance. This study investigates the effects of winglet cant angles on both the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a commercial wing, comparing them to other significant parameters using a parametric analysis. A Full Factorial Design method is employed to generate a matrix of experiments, facilitating a detailed exploration of flow physics, with lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) and the integral of Acoustic Power Level (APL) as the primary representatives of aerodynamic and acoustic performance, respectively. The RANS formulation, along with the \(k{-}\epsilon\) Realizable model and the Broadband Noise Source (BNS) model, are utilized to accurately simulate subsonic flows numerically. The study begins by examining the pressure coefficient (\(C_p\)) and APL distributions at various cant angles near the wingtip and root areas. The matrix of experiments is then analyzed to identify the most influential parameters based on the main effects of inputs and their two-way interactions. The results demonstrate that variations in winglet cant angle significantly alter the distribution of \(C_p\) and APL along the span, particularly near the wingtip, and that cant angle strongly impacts overall performance, at times even outweighing atmospheric parameters such as pressure and temperature.","['Erfan Vaezi', 'S.

Identifying regions of importance in wall-bounded turbulence through explainable deep learning,"Despite its great scientific and technological importance, wall-bounded turbulence is an unresolved problem in classical physics that requires new perspectives to be tackled. One of the key strategies has been to study interactions among the energy-containing coherent structures in the flow. Such interactions are explored in this study using an explainable deep-learning method. The instantaneous velocity field obtained from a turbulent channel flow simulation is used to predict the velocity field in time through a U-net architecture. Based on the predicted flow, we assess the importance of each structure for this prediction using the game-theoretic algorithm of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This work provides results in agreement with previous observations in the literature and extends them by revealing that the most important structures in the flow are not necessarily the ones with the highest contribution to the Reynolds shear stress. We also apply the method to an experimental database, where we can identify structures based on their importance score. This framework has the potential to shed light on numerous fundamental phenomena of wall-bounded turbulence, including novel strategies for flow control.","['Andrés Cremades', 'Sergio Hoyas', 'Rahul Deshpande', 'Pedro Quintero', 'Martin Lellep', 'Will Junghoon Lee', 'Jason P.

Control optimization of air traffic emissions in a two-variable dynamic model,"Since 1999, every report released by the International Panel on Climate Change has advocated a decrease in the greenhouse gas emissions associated with aviation in order to preserve the current climate. This study used a two variable differential equations model with a non-linear control term to address several aspects of the emissions stabilization issue. By optimizing the control term parameter, several management alternatives can be obtained based on the properties of the phase plane of the model solutions, as identified by a stability analysis. The system can be stabilised around an equilibrium point that maintains the present number of passengers, or maintains the emissions level or is nearest to its present state. Each of these options entails different issues of growth or reduction in the number of passengers and/or the emissions rate, directly obtained from the model results. The last option seems especially novel and promising, since only short-distance flight passengers are severely reduced, while long-distance and international passengers are allowed to growth, and their associated emissions are reduced to below 50 percent of their actual value. Moreover, in a scenario of slow growth in air traffic, these rates could improve, with fewer reductions in the number of short-distance passengers.","['F. A. Buendía-Hernández', 'M. J.

A broad-spectrum gas sensor based on correlated two-dimensional electron gas,"Designing a broad-spectrum gas sensor capable of identifying gas components in complex environments, such as mixed atmospheres or extreme temperatures, is a significant concern for various technologies, including energy, geological science, and planetary exploration. The main challenge lies in finding materials that exhibit high chemical stability and wide working temperature range. Materials that amplify signals through non-chemical methods could open up new sensing avenues. Here, we present the discovery of a broad-spectrum gas sensor utilizing correlated two-dimensional electron gas at a delta-doped LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface with LaFeO3. Our study reveals that a back-gating on this two-dimensional electron gas can induce a non-volatile metal to insulator transition, which consequently can activate the two-dimensional electron gas to sensitively and quantitatively probe very broad gas species, no matter whether they are polar, non-polar, or inert gases. Different gas species cause resistance change at their sublimation or boiling temperature and a well-defined phase transition angle can quantitatively determine their partial pressures. Such unique correlated two-dimensional electron gas sensor is not affected by gas mixtures and maintains a wide operating temperature range.

Modeling and dynamic analysis of split torsion transmission system considering backlash and center distance errors,"The split torque gear transmission holds significant potential for use in helicopter main reducer transmission systems due to its benefits of low noise, high power-to-weight ratio, and high reliability. In this context, a nonlinear dynamic equation was formulated in the present study for a single-input dual-output gear split-torque transmission system, and the system’s dynamic behavior was examined under the effects of center distance error and backlash using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The findings indicate that the impact of center distance error on the system’s dynamics is linear, whereas the effect of backlash is nonlinear. Moreover, the center distance error in the parallel-level stage and the backlash in the split-torsion stage are critical factors influencing the system’s dynamic characteristics. These insights can aid in selecting and allocating design parameters, offering valuable practical applications in engineering.","['Jingwei Ding', 'Guanghu Jin']",07-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81753-9
Synergistic morphology and feedback control for traversal of unknown compliant obstacles with aerial robots,"Animals traverse vegetation by direct physical interaction using their entire body to push aside and slide along compliant obstacles. Current drones lack this interaction versatility that stems from synergies between body morphology and feedback control modulated by sensing. Taking inspiration from nature, we show that a task-oriented design allows a drone with a minimalistic controller to traverse obstacles with unknown elastic responses. A discoid sensorized shell allows to establish and sense contacts anywhere along the shell and facilitates sliding along obstacles. This simplifies the formalization of the control strategy, which does not require a model of the interaction with the environment, nor high-level switching conditions for alternating between pushing and sliding. We utilize an optimization-based controller that ensures safety constraints on the robot’s state and dampens the oscillations of the environment during interaction, even if the elastic response is unknown and variable. Experimental evaluation, using a hinged surface with three different stiffness values ranging from 18 to 155.5 N mm rad−1, validates the proposed embodied aerial physical interaction strategy. By also showcasing the traversal of isolated branches, this work makes an initial contribution toward enabling drone flight across cluttered vegetation, with potential applications in environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and search and rescue.","['Emanuele Aucone', 'Christian Geckeler', 'Daniele Morra', 'Lucia Pallottino', 'Stefano Mintchev']",26-Mar-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46967-5
Global stability boundary analysis and verification of aviation pressure servo-controlled actuator system,"In this paper, the mathematical model of the aviation pressure servo valve controlled actuator system(APSVCAS) considering nonlinearity is established based on a jet pipe pressure servo valve in this article. And the dynamic characteristics and stability boundary of APSVCAS are analyzed, which provides theoretical guidance for the actual composition and the determination of parameters. Firstly, a jet-tube two-stage pressure servo valve for aviation hydraulic system is designed, and an accurate model of APSVCAS is established considering multiple nonlinear factors. Meantime, the influence of 34 parameters on the dynamic characteristics of the system is analyzed by using the second-order sensitivity analysis method. And the key parameters that significantly affect the dynamic characteristics of the system are extracted. Based on this, the system stability discrimination method is proposed from the perspectives of frequency domain and time domain, and the stability boundary of key parameters is obtained. Finally, the theoretical analysis results are verified on the experimental platform of APSVCAS. The experimental results show that the mathematical model of APSVCAS considering nonlinearity has satisfactory accuracy. Concomitantly, it is verified that the parameters’ stability boundary condition based on the sensitivity analysis method meet the stable output effect of the system under multiple working conditions.","['Zhipeng Huang', 'Xinjie Li', 'Zeyu Cao', 'Chentian Ma', 'Yunhe Wang', 'Bin Yu', 'Guoliang Ma', 'Xiangdong Kong']",02-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83809-2
Electrothermally controlled origami fabricated by 4D printing of continuous fiber-reinforced composites,"Active origami capable of precise deployment control, enabling on-demand modulation of its properties, is highly desirable in multi-scenario and multi-task applications. While 4D printing with shape memory composites holds great promise to realize such active origami, it still faces challenges such as low load-bearing capacity and limited transformable states. Here, we report a fabrication-design-actuation method of precisely controlled electrothermal origami with excellent mechanical performance and spatiotemporal controllability, utilizing 4D printing of continuous fiber-reinforced composites. The incorporation of continuous carbon fibers empowers electrothermal origami with a controllable actuation process via Joule heating, increased actuation force through improved heat conduction, and enhanced mechanical properties as a result of reinforcement. By modeling the multi-physical and highly nonlinear deploying process, we attain precise control over the active origami, allowing it to be reconfigured and locked into any desired configuration by manipulating activation parameters. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of electrothermal origami by constructing reconfigurable robots, customizable architected materials, and programmable wings, which broadens the practical engineering applications of origami.","['Yaohui Wang', 'Haitao Ye', 'Jian He', 'Qi Ge', 'Yi Xiong']",14-Mar-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46591-3
Joint suppression method for range-Doppler ambiguity sidelobes in DTMB-based passive bistatic radar,"To mitigate the impact of the suboptimal ambiguity function of digital television terrestrial multimedia broadcasting (DTMB) signal, used as the illuminator of opportunity in passive bistatic radar, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the ambiguity function characteristics based on the physical structure of the DTMB signal frame. It elucidates the mechanisms behind intra-frame and inter-frame range sidelobes, as well as Doppler sidelobes. Building on this analysis, a novel joint method for suppressing range-Doppler ambiguity sidelobes is proposed to achieve unambiguous target detection.

Robust STAP with coprime sampling structure based on optimal singular value thresholding,"In radar systems, element gain-phase errors can degrade the performance of space–time adaptive processing (STAP), and even cause complete failure. To address this issue, the STAP with the coprime sampling structure based on optimal singular value thresholding is proposed. The algorithm corrects errors by adding four calibrated auxiliary elements and auxiliary pulses to the original array and pulse sequence, while maintaining the coprime sampling structure. The corrected virtual clutter covariance matrix (CCM) is then expanded and filled with holes. Subsequently, the optimal singular value thresholding method is used to restore the CCM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows advantages in convergence speed, detection probability, and stability.","['Mingxin Liu', 'Mingfu Li', 'Hui Li', 'Yan Cheng']",02-Jan-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83857-8
Evaluation of L6 augmentation signal reception characteristics and positioning accuracy of compact and lightweight GNSS antennas,"Applications requiring outdoor position estimation, such as unmanned construction and delivery automation, focus on receiving global navigation satellite system (GNSS) correction information from satellites for high-precision positioning. In particular, the delivery of correction information for the Galileo high-accuracy service (HAS) and quasi-zenith satellite system (QZSS) centimeter-level augmentation service (CLAS) is based on a new frequency band called L6. The L6 signal is a new type of GNSS signal, and a GNSS antenna corresponding to the frequency of the L6 signal (1275.46 MHz) is required to receive and decode the correction messages. The reception characteristics of the L6 signal are important for receiving correction information. However, the reception performance of antennas supporting the new L6 signal has not been evaluated. Therefore, in this study, we evaluate the reception characteristics of the L6 signal of a compact and lightweight L6-compatible antenna, and the multipath characteristics, which are the fundamental performance of the antenna that affects high-precision positioning. In a 24-hour static test, each antenna’s signal reception performance and multipath characteristics were evaluated, and significant differences were found in performance among the antennas capable of receiving the L6 signal. Furthermore, in a kinematic test, we evaluated high-accuracy positioning using QZSS CLAS with multiple antennas and showed that centimeter-level positioning using L6 augmentation signals is possible even with compact and lightweight GNSS antennas. These evaluations provide guidelines for antenna selection when high-precision positioning using L6 signals is employed in various applications.",['Taro Suzuki'],08-Dec-23,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-48954-0
Random impact force localisation enabled by the weighted reference database method,"The mechanical properties of an engineering structure can be substantially influenced by a random impact force (RIF), which may compromise the integrity and safety of the structure. Nevertheless, accurately localising the RIF applied to a structure presents a significant challenge. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel method known as the weighted reference database method (WRDM). Its innovations are reflected in three aspects: (i) constrained by the sparse construction of a reference database, bicubic interpolation is utilised to increase the reference impact point density and improve the localisation accuracy; (ii) a weighted random impact localisation framework is constructed, in which a cosine distance variant is chosen as the weight to further improve the localisation accuracy; and (iii) to overcome the region limitation of interpolation, the boundary range of the WRDM is extended. Experiments on a suspended rectangular plate were conducted to validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the WRDM in terms of localisation accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the average absolute error of the method is 16.67 mm (the interpolation interval size is 2 mm and the prioritisation point number (PPN) is 108), and its localisation accuracy is higher than that of previously published methods (21.54 mm for PRMCSM; 20.80 mm for the hybrid method).","['Binbin Qiu', 'Siqi Liu', 'Weidong Li', 'Chunhua Feng', 'Yu Zhu', 'Haoran Liu']",30-Dec-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83812-7
A deep learning approach for predicting the antenna pointing error caused by transmission faults with simulation data,"Reflector antenna has been widely used in deep space exploration, radar warning, and other fields, all of which requires high pointing accuracy. The antenna elevation bearings are the key component that guarantees its pointing accuracy, while any degradation or fault can seriously affect the antenna’s performance, leading to deviations in antenna pointing and instability during operation. However, the relationship between the antenna elevation bearing fault and its pointing accuracy remains unclear because there is insufficient experimental faulty transmission data and pointing error collected from the test-rig simultaneously. Therefore, this paper aims to establish a deep learning model-based relationship to reveal the underlying relationship between the antenna transmission faults and its pointing accuracy. By linking the two, transmission faults in key components can serve as a substitute for pointing accuracy as one of the criteria for antenna maintenance decisions, vibration signals, serving as a basis for fault diagnosis, can be collected and processed in real-time without the need for equipment shutdowns, undoubtedly bringing convenience to antenna maintenance providing a theoretical basis for the development of antenna maintenance strategies. In order to overcome the problem of insufficient data, this paper has established an antenna elevation system dynamic simulation model containing pre-defined transmission faults. Furthermore, to link antenna fault diagnosis with antenna pointing errors, a mathematical model for antenna axis error analysis has been established. Finally, labeled fault data and antenna pointing errors have been put into the deep neural network model for training to obtain the prediction model for predicting antenna axis error. The results showed that faults in the key transmission components have a significant impact on antenna pointing errors and the proposed deep neural network learning model exhibits a high predictive accuracy.","['Lihui Chen', 'Song Xue', 'Peiyuan Lian', 'Qian Xu', 'Meng Wang', 'Congsi Wang']",30-Dec-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83103-1
Acoustic transmission loss in Hilbert fractal metamaterials,"Acoustic metamaterials are increasingly being considered as a viable technology for sound insulation. Fractal patterns constitute a potentially groundbreaking architecture for acoustic metamaterials. We describe in this work the behaviour of the transmission loss of Hilbert fractal metamaterials used for sound control purposes. The transmission loss of 3D printed metamaterials with Hilbert fractal patterns related to configurations from the zeroth to the fourth order is investigated here using impedance tube tests and Finite Element models. We evaluate, in particular, the impact of the equivalent porosity and the relative size of the cavity of the fractal pattern versus the overall dimensions of the metamaterial unit. We also provide an analytical formulation that relates the acoustic cavity resonances in the fractal patterns and the frequencies associated with the maxima of the transmission losses, providing opportunities to tune the sound insulation properties through control of the fractal architecture.","['Gianni Comandini', 'Morvan Ouisse', 'Valeska P.

Fuel mixing enhancement of transverse coaxial air and fuel jet by upstream shock wave on in scramjet engines: numerical study,"In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to disclose the impacts of upstream shock waves on fuel mixing of cross coaxial air and fuel jet at a scramjet engine.

The supersonic air stream is M = 4 while cross hydrogen and air jet are released in sonic velocity. This study uses CFD simulations to analyze the effects of upstream shock waves on fuel mixing in the transverse coaxial jet and assess their potential for improving combustion efficiency. The results demonstrate that the usage of upstream shock waves significantly increases shock interactions and augments the vortex region downstream of the jet.

Simulative validation of a novel experiment carrier for the Einstein-Elevator,"In order to develop hardware that can be used in space, tests under those space conditions are often important to ensure the functionality in advance. Facilities that are used to recreate gravity conditions of space include space stations, satellites, parabolic flights and earthbound facilities. Drop towers are earthbound facilities, that can replicate the gravitational conditions of free falling in space by dropping objects. Those objects would not experience any measurable force due to gravity according to Einstein’s famous thought experiment. The Einstein-Elevator is one of the first active driven drop towers with an experiment carrier falling inside a gondola. A major indicator for the quality of the facility is the residual acceleration of the payload. With the Einstein-Elevators current setup vibrations of the experiment carrier cause measurable residual accelerations of higher than \(10^{-3}\)g. To achieve the targeted 0-g-quality with a residual acceleration of less than 1 \(\mu \)g (microgravity) in the Einstein-Elevator, a new experiment carrier is required that minimizes the residual acceleration for a payload.

Atmospheric turbulence strength distribution along a propagation path probed by longitudinally structured optical beams,"Atmospheric turbulence can cause critical problems in many applications. To effectively avoid or mitigate turbulence, knowledge of turbulence strength at various distances could be of immense value. Due to light-matter interaction, optical beams can probe longitudinal turbulence changes. Unfortunately, previous approaches tended to be limited to relatively short distances or large transceivers. Here, we explore turbulence probing utilizing multiple sequentially transmitted longitudinally structured beams. Each beam is composed of Bessel-Gaussian (\({{{{{{\rm{BG}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\mathcal{l}}}}}}{{=}}0,{k}_{z}}\)) modes with different \({k}_{z}\) values such that a distance-varying beam width is produced, which results in a distance- and turbulence-dependent modal coupling to \({{{{{\mathcal{l}}}}}}{{{{{\mathscr{\ne }}}}}}0\) orders. Our simulation shows that this approach has relatively uniform and low errors (<0.3 dB) over a 10-km path with up to 30-dB turbulence-structure-constant variation. We experimentally demonstrate this approach for two emulated turbulence regions (~15-dB variation) with <0.8-dB errors. Compared to previous techniques, our approach can potentially probe longer distances or require smaller transceivers.","['Huibin Zhou', 'Xinzhou Su', 'Yuxiang Duan', 'Hao Song', 'Kaiheng Zou', 'Runzhou Zhang', 'Haoqian Song', 'Nanzhe Hu', 'Moshe Tur', 'Alan E.

Distributed coordinated motion control of multiple UAVs oriented to optimization of air-ground relay network,"A novel adaptive model-based motion control method for multi-UAV communication relay is proposed, which aims at improving the networks connectivity and the communications performance among a fleet of ground unmanned vehicles. The method addresses the challenge of relay UAVs motion control through joint consideration with unknown multi-user mobility, environmental effects on channel characteristics, unavailable angle-of-arrival data of received signals, and coordination among multiple UAVs. The method consists of two parts: (1) Network connectivity is constructed and communication performance index is defined using the minimum spanning tree in graph theory, which considers both the communication link between ground node and UAV, and the communication link between ground nodes. (2) A multi-UAV motion control strategy is proposed that combines Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) and Distributed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (DNMPC), where the Kalman filter is utilised to estimate future positions of the mobile nodes.

Generative adversarial networks with texture recovery and physical constraints for remote sensing image dehazing,"The scattering of tiny particles in the atmosphere causes a haze effect on remote sensing images captured by satellites and similar devices, significantly disrupting subsequent image recognition and classification. A generative adversarial network named TRPC-GAN with texture recovery and physical constraints is proposed to mitigate this impact. This network not only effectively removes haze but also better preserves the texture information of the original remote sensing image, thereby enhancing the visual quality of the dehazed image. A multi-scale module is proposed to extract feature information of remote sensing images, allowing it to capture image features from different receptive fields. Simultaneously, an attention module is designed further to guide the network’s focus towards important feature information. In addition, a multi-scale adversarial network is proposed to better restore both global and local information about the original image. Introducing a physical constraint loss function to improve the loss function of the original generative adversarial network allows for better preservation of the physical characteristics of remote sensing images. Simulation experiments on synthetic and natural hazy remote sensing image datasets are conducted. The results demonstrate that the dehazing performance of the TRPC-GAN method surpasses the other four methods.","['Yanfei Jia', 'Wenshuo Yu', 'Liquan Zhao']",28-Dec-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83088-x
GPS/VIO integrated navigation system based on factor graph and fuzzy logic,"In today’s technologically advanced landscape, precision in navigation and positioning holds paramount importance across various applications, from robotics to autonomous vehicles. A common predicament in location-based systems is the reliance on Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, which may exhibit diminished accuracy and reliability under certain conditions. Moreover, when integrated with the Inertial Navigation System (INS), the GPS/INS system could not provide a long-term solution for outage problems due to its accumulated errors. This article introduces a novel graph-based method that utilizes a dynamically adjustable fuzzy window to improve navigation and positioning accuracy. This approach effectively integrates GPS data with Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO). Additionally, it proposes a novel technique for motion estimation and feature extraction, called Adaptive Feature-Flow Fusion, which facilitates robust performance in environments with both high- and low-feature content. The proposed GPS/VIO system is a compelling solution for mitigating GPS-based navigation’s accuracy and reliability concerns. It was implemented and tested on Jetson’s embedded board platform to ensure optimal and real-time system performance. The results from these tests are comprehensively detailed in this article. The system underwent stringent evaluation using the KITTI dataset, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements compared to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) system. Specifically, the GPS/VIO system exhibited remarkable accuracy improvements of 84.59% and 88.806% during GPS outages lasting 10 and 27 s, respectively. Furthermore, to enhance precision, data preprocessing techniques were incorporated. These techniques involve optimizing image data by adjusting contrast and brightness levels and applying noise reduction to the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data.

Application of multilayered porous media for heat transfer optimization in double pipe heat exchangers using neural network and NSGA II,"This study investigates the use of multi-layered porous media (MLPM) to enhance thermal energy transfer within a counterflow double-pipe heat exchanger (DPHE). We conducted computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations on DPHEs featuring five distinct MLPM configurations, analyzed under both fully filled and partially filled conditions, alongside a conventional DPHE. The impact of various parameters such as porous layer arrangements, thickness, and flow Reynolds numbers on pressure drop, logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD), and performance evaluation criterion (PEC) was assessed. The results demonstrate that the PEC improves by approximately three times with the optimal MLPM configuration, where the porous layers decrease from the interfacial wall outward under fully filled conditions. To further optimize performance, we trained a neural network using 507 simulations to establish a continuous correlation between input variables and output results. A multi-objective optimization was then implemented using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to identify the optimal operating conditions. The Pareto front of the optimal points was established, allowing designers to select specific points based on their operational requirements. This research provides valuable insights into the potential of MLPM to significantly enhance the thermohydraulic performance of DPHEs and establishes a framework for future optimization studies.","['Hamid-Reza Bahrami', 'Amir-Erfan Sharifi']",28-Dec-24,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83176-y
Scheduling optimization of ship plane block flow line considering dual resource constraints,"A well-designed scheduling plan that meets the practical constraints of the workshop is crucial for enhancing production efficiency in ship plane block assembly. Unlike traditional flow line scheduling problems, the scheduling optimization problem for ship plane block flow line involves dual resource constraints, including work teams and spare parts supply limitations. This can be seen as a Dual Resource Constrained Blocked Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (DRCBFSP). This paper presents a scheduling optimization method for this kind of problem to minimize the maximum completion time. To address the dual constraints, chromosomes are encoded as a two-dimensional array composed of positive integers representing the assembly order of blocks and the allocation of work teams. An improved Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (IGWO) is proposed to solve the problem, and the Rank Order Value (ROV) rule is used to transform the discrete scheduling solution with the continuous individual position vector. The IGWO algorithm also incorporates nonlinear search factors, dynamic inertia weight factors, and Gaussian mutation perturbation strategies to enhance its development and exploration capabilities.

Grasping extreme aerodynamics on a low-dimensional manifold,"Modern air vehicles perform a wide range of operations, including transportation, defense, surveillance, and rescue. These aircraft can fly in calm conditions but avoid operations in gusty environments, encountered in urban canyons, over mountainous terrains, and in ship wakes. With extreme weather becoming ever more frequent due to global warming, it is anticipated that aircraft, especially those that are smaller in size, will encounter sizeable atmospheric disturbances and still be expected to achieve stable flight. However, there exists virtually no theoretical fluid-dynamic foundation to describe the influence of extreme vortical gusts on wings. To compound this difficulty, there is a large parameter space for gust-wing interactions. While such interactions are seemingly complex and different for each combination of gust parameters, we show that the fundamental physics behind extreme aerodynamics is far simpler and lower-rank than traditionally expected. We reveal that the nonlinear vortical flow field over time and parameter space can be compressed to only three variables with a lift-augmented autoencoder while holding the essence of the original high-dimensional physics. Extreme aerodynamic flows can be compressed through machine learning into a low-dimensional manifold, which can enable real-time sparse reconstruction, dynamical modeling, and control of extremely unsteady gusty flows. The present findings offer support for the stable flight of next-generation small air vehicles in atmosphere conditions traditionally considered unflyable.","['Kai Fukami', 'Kunihiko Taira']",14-Oct-23,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42213-6
Prolonged in situ self-healing in structural composites via thermo-reversible entanglement,"Natural processes continuously degrade a material’s performance throughout its life cycle. An emerging class of synthetic self-healing polymers and composites possess property-retaining functions with the promise of longer lifetimes. But sustained in-service repair of structural fiber-reinforced composites remains unfulfilled due to material heterogeneity and thermodynamic barriers in commonly cross-linked polymer-matrix constituents. Overcoming these inherent challenges for mechanical self-recovery is vital to extend in-service operation and attain widespread adoption of such bioinspired structural materials. Here we transcend existing obstacles and report a fiber-composite capable of minute-scale and prolonged in situ healing — 100 cycles: an order of magnitude higher than prior studies. By 3D printing a mendable thermoplastic onto woven glass/carbon fiber reinforcement and co-laminating with electrically resistive heater interlayers, we achieve in situ thermal remending of internal delamination via dynamic bond re-association. Full fracture recovery occurs below the glass-transition temperature of the thermoset epoxy-matrix composite, thus preserving stiffness during and after repair. A discovery of chemically driven improvement in thermal remending of glass- over carbon-fiber composites is also revealed. The marked lifetime extension offered by this self-healing strategy mitigates costly maintenance, facilitates repair of difficult-to-access structures (e.g., wind-turbine blades), and reduces part replacement, thereby benefiting economy and environment.","['Alexander D.

Feasibility test of per-flight contrail avoidance in commercial aviation,"Contrails, formed by aircraft engines, are a major component of aviation’s impact on anthropogenic climate change. Contrail avoidance is a potential option to mitigate this warming effect, however, uncertainties surrounding operational constraints and accurate formation prediction make it unclear whether it is feasible. Here we address this gap with a feasibility test through a randomized controlled trial of contrail avoidance in commercial aviation at the per-flight level. Predictions for regions prone to contrail formation came from a physics-based simulation model and a machine learning model. Participating pilots made altitude adjustments based on contrail formation predictions for flights assigned to the treatment group. Using satellite-based imagery we observed 64% fewer contrails in these flights relative to the control group flights, a statistically significant reduction (p = 0.0331). Our targeted per-flight intervention allowed the airline to track their expected vs actual fuel usage, we found that there is a 2% increase in fuel per adjusted flight. This study demonstrates that per-flight detectable contrail avoidance is feasible in commercial aviation.","['Aaron Sonabend-W', 'Carl Elkin', 'Thomas Dean', 'John Dudley', 'Noman Ali', 'Jill Blickstein', 'Erica Brand', 'Brian Broshears', 'Sixing Chen', 'Zebediah Engberg', 'Mark Galyen', 'Scott Geraedts', 'Nita Goyal', 'Rebecca Grenham', 'Ulrike Hager', 'Deborah Hecker', 'Marco Jany', 'Kevin McCloskey', 'Joe Ng', 'Brian Norris', 'Frank Opel', 'Juliet Rothenberg', 'Tharun Sankar', 'Dinesh Sanekommu', 'Aaron Sarna', 'Ole Schütt', 'Marc Shapiro', 'Rachel Soh', 'Christopher Van Arsdale', 'John C.

Impact damage reduction of woven composites subject to pulse current,"3D orthogonal woven composites are receiving increasing attention with the ever-growing market of composites. A current challenge for these materials’ development is how to improve their damage tolerance in orthogonal and layer-to-layer structures under extreme loads. In this paper, a damage reduction strategy is proposed by combining structural and electromagnetic properties. An integrated experimental platform is designed combining a power system, a drop-testing machine, and data acquisition devices to investigate the effects of pulse current and impact force on woven composites. Experimental results demonstrate that pulse current can effectively reduce delamination damage and residual deformation. A multi-field coupled damage model is developed to analyze the evolutions of temperature, current and damage. Parallel current-carrying carbon fibers that cause yarns to be transversely compressed enhance the mechanical properties. Moreover, the microcrack formation and extrusion deformation in yarns cause the redistribution of local current among carbon fibers, and its interaction with the self-field produces an obvious anti-impact effect. The obtained results reveal the mechanism of damage reduction and provide a potential approach for improving damage tolerance of these composites.","['Yan Li', 'Fusheng Wang', 'Chenguang Huang', 'Jianting Ren', 'Donghong Wang', 'Jie Kong', 'Tao Liu', 'Laohu Long']",19-Aug-23,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40752-6
Reservoir computing-based signal compensation for laser inter-satellite communications,"We introduce the reservoir computing (RC) concept into the laser processing unit for the scenario of the inter-satellite communication to mitigate the impacts from the multi-distortion sources, enabling significantly improving the quality of the coherent signals through the intelligent approach in outer space. We carry out the experimental investigations to quantify the impacts from the Sun radiation, the Doppler frequency shift and the vibration on the transmitted quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK) signals, and perform the signal compensation through only one RC module at the receiver end. A maximum 5.59dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement has been achieved in the experiment when the three distortion-sources applied simultaneously, confirming the compensation capability for the laser inter-satellite communication.","['Feng Wen', 'Juan Yong', 'Jian-Jun Li', 'Shui-Qiu Diao']",15-Feb-25,Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90321-8
